#THIS PACKAGE WILL BE DISCONTINUED!
==================================

## Please move to the newer (better!) YVES [github](https://github.com/jorisroling/yves) or [atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/jorisroling/yves)

This was (!) a Meteor implementation of [eyes](https://github.com/cloudhead/eyes.js)

Implements **eyes(anything)** on server and client.

Also registeres a template helper so that ```{{{eyes this}}}``` will show
and eye icon, that toggles a box with the pretty printed content.

As a debug aid, you can also use an extra __host pattern__ like ```{{{eyes this "localhost"}}}```
